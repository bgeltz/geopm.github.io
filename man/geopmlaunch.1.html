</p>

<h2 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p><code>geopmlaunch</code> <em>launcher</em> [<em>launcher_opt</em>] [<em>geopm_opt</em>] <code>--</code> <em>executable</em> [<em>executable_opt</em>]</p>

<h2 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The <code>geopmlaunch</code> application enables execution of the GEOPM runtime
along with a distributed parallel compute application, <em>executable</em>,
using the command line interface for the underlying application
scheduler, <em>launcher</em>, deployed on the HPC system.  The <code>geopmlaunch</code>
command line interface is designed to support many application
schedulers including SLURM <code>srun</code>, ALPS <code>aprun</code>, and Intel / MPICH
<code>mpiexec</code>.  The <code>geopmlaunch</code> command line interface has been designed
to wrap the underlying application scheduler while reinterpreting the
command line options, <em>launcher_opt</em>, specified for it.  In this way,
the user can easily modify an existing job launch command to enable
the GEOPM runtime by prefixing the command with <code>geopmlaunch</code> and
extending the existing scheduler options with the the options for the
GEOPM runtime, <em>geopm_opt</em>.  The GEOPM runtime options control the
behavior of the GEOPM runtime and are detailed in the <code>GEOPM OPTIONS</code>
section below.</p>

<p>All command line options accepted by the underlying job scheduler
(e.g. <code>srun</code> or <code>aprun</code>) can be passed to the <code>geopmlaunch</code> wrapper
with the exception of CPU affinity related options.  The wrapper
script reinterprets the command line to pass modified options and set
environment variables for the underlying application scheduler.  The
GEOPM options, <em>geopm_opt</em>, are translated into environment variables
to be interpreted by the GEOPM runtime (see the ENVIRONMENT section of
<strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>).  The reinterpreted command line, including the
environment modification, is printed to standard output by the script
before execution.  The command that is printed can be executed in the
<code>bash</code> shell to replicate the execution without using <code>geopmlaunch</code>
directly.  The command is modified to support the GEOPM control thread
by setting CPU affinity for each process and increasing the number of
processes per node or CPUs per process.</p>

<p>Note: the primary compute <em>executable</em> and its options,
<em>executable_opt</em>, must appear at the end of the command line and be
preceded by two dashes: <code>--</code>. The GEOPM launcher will not parse
arguments to the right of the first <code>--</code> sequence and will pass the
arguments that follow unaltered while removing the first <code>--</code> from the
command line.  Refer to the EXAMPLES section below.</p>

<h2 id="SUPPORTED-LAUNCHERS">SUPPORTED LAUNCHERS</h2>

<p>The launcher is selected by specifying the <em>launcher</em> as the first
command line parameter.  Available <em>launcher</em> values are
listed below.</p>

<dl>
<dt><em>srun</em>, <em>SrunLauncher</em></dt><dd><p>Wrapper for the SLURM resource manager's <code>srun</code> job launcher.  The

</dl>


<h2 id="GEOPM-OPTIONS">GEOPM OPTIONS</h2>

<dl>
<dt><code>--geopm-report</code> path</dt><dd><p>Specifies the path to the GEOPM report output file that is generated
at the conclusion of the run if this option is provided.  If the
option is not provided, a report named "geopm.report" will be created.
The GEOPM report contains a summary of the profiling information
collected by GEOPM throughout the application execution.  The report
contains information about runtimes, MPI usage, and energy
consumption for each compute node used by the application.  The
report is broken down by compute node and then by region.  The
regions are defined by use of the <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm_prof_c.3.html">geopm_prof_c<span class="s">(3)</span></a></strong> interface to
mark up the user application or automatic inference of regions based
on interposing on the MPI or OpenMP interfaces (interposing on
OpenMP requires that the optional configuration parameter
<code>--enable-ompt</code> is provided at GEOPM compile time, and the
<code>--geopm-ompt-disable</code> option is not provided to <code>geopmlaunch</code>). Note that
the sampled values, like 'energy', are accumulated into the sum for a
region only when all ranks on a compute node are concurrently
executing the same region; otherwise statistics gathered are
accumulated within the 'unmarked-region'.  Also note that the
<code>sync-runtime</code> accumulates the total amount of time when all ranks
within a compute node were synchronously within the region.  The
<code>runtime</code> value is the time spent within a region by a rank averaged
over all ranks on the node regardless of synchronicity of execution.
The "Application totals" are not calculated by sampling throughout
the run, but rather by differencing values measured at the start and
end of the application.  When comparing energy and time values from
the report, care should be taken to use 'runtime' in the case of
application totals, and 'sync-runtime' for all other regions.  This
option is used by the launcher to set the <code>GEOPM_REPORT</code> environment
variable.  The command line option will override any value currently
set in the environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of
<strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-report-signals</code> signals</dt><dd><p>Used to insert additional measurements into the report beyond the
default values.  This feature requires that the requested signals
are increasing monotonically with time.  Each time a region is
entered or exited the value of the signals is measured.  When the
region is exited the value of the signal upon entry is subtracted
from the value of the signal upon exit.  The total given in the
report for the signal associated with the region is the cumulative
sum of the differences for each occurrence of the region.  The value
must be formatted as a comma-separated list of valid signal names.
The signals available and their descriptions are documented in the
<strong><span class="man-ref">PlatformIO<span class="s">(3)</span></span></strong> man page.</p>

<p>By default the signals in the report will be aggregated to the board
domain.  A domain other than board can be specified by appending the
signal name with an "@" character and then specifying one of the
domains.  For example, the following will extend the region and
application totals sections of the report with package energy for
each package and DRAM energy summed over the all DIMMs:</p>

<p><code>--geopm-report-signals=ENERGY_PACKAGE@package,ENERGY_DRAM</code></p>

<p>The <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmread.1.html">geopmread<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> executable enables discovery of signals and
domains available on your system.  The signal names and domain names
given for this parameter are specified as in the <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmread.1.html">geopmread<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong>
command line interface.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-trace</code> path</dt><dd><p>The base name and path of the trace file(s) generated if this option
is specified.  One trace file is generated for each compute node
used by the application containing a pipe-delimited ASCII table
describing a time series of measurements made by the GEOPM runtime.
The path is extended with the host name of the node for each created
file.  The trace files will be written to the file system path
specified or current directory if only a file name is given.  This
feature is primarily a debugging tool, and may not scale to large
node counts due to file system issues.  This option is used by the
launcher to set the GEOPM_TRACE environment variable.  The command
line option will override any value currently set in the
environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-trace-signals</code> signals</dt><dd><p>Used to insert additional columns into the trace beyond the default
columns and the columns added by the Agent.  This option has no
effect unless tracing is enabled with <code>--geopm-trace</code>.  The value
must be formatted as a comma-separated list of valid signal names.
When not specified all custom signals added to the trace will be
sampled and aggregated for the entire node unless the domain is
specified by appending "@domain_type" to the signal name.  For
example, the following will add total DRAM energy and power as
columns in the trace:</p>

<p><code>--geopm-trace-signals=ENERGY_DRAM,POWER_DRAM</code></p>

<p>The signals available and their descriptions are documented in the
<strong><span class="man-ref">PlatformIO<span class="s">(3)</span></span></strong> man page.  "TIME", "REGION_HASH", "REGION_HINT",
"REGION_PROGRESS", "REGION_RUNTIME", "ENERGY_PACKAGE",
"POWER_PACKAGE", and "FREQUENCY" are included in the trace by
default.  A domain other than board can be specified by appending
the signal name with an "@" character and then specifying one of the
domains, e.g:</p>

<p><code>--geopm-trace-signals=POWER_PACKAGE@package,ENERGY_PACKAGE@package</code></p>

<p>will trace the package power and energy for each package on the
system.  The <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmread.1.html">geopmread<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> executable enables discovery of
signals and domains available on your system.  The signal names and
domain names given for this parameter are specified as in the
<strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmread.1.html">geopmread<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> command line interface.  This option is used by the
launcher to set the GEOPM_TRACE_SIGNALS environment variable.  The
command line option will override any value currently set in the
environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-trace-profile</code> path</dt><dd><p>The base name and path of the profile trace file(s) generated if
this option is specified.  One trace file is generated for each
compute node used by the application containing a pipe-delimited
ASCII table describing a log of each call to the <code>geopm_prof_*()</code>
APIs.  The path is extended with the host name of the node for each
created file.  The profile trace files will be written to the file
system path specified or current directory if only a file name is
given.  This feature is primarily a debugging tool, and may not
scale to large node counts due to file system issues.  This option
is used by the launcher to set the GEOPM_TRACE_PROFILE environment
variable.  The command line option will override any value currently
set in the environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of
<strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-trace-endpoint-policy</code> path</dt><dd><p>The path to the endpoint policy trace file generated if this option
is specified.  This file tracks only policies sent through the
endpoint at the root controller, not all policies within the
controller tree.  If <code>--geopm-endpoint</code> is not provided, or if the
agent does not have any policy values, this file will not be
created.  This option is used by the launcher to set the
GEOPM_TRACE_ENDPOINT_POLICY environment variable.  The command line
option will override any value currently set in the environment.
See the ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-profile</code> name</dt><dd><p>The name of the profile which is printed in the report and trace
files.  This name can be used to index the data in post-processing.
For example, when running a sweep of experiments with multiple power
caps, the profile could contain the power setting for one run.  The
default profile name is the name of the compute application
executable.  This option is used by the launcher to set the
GEOPM_PROFILE environment variable.  The command line option will
override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-ctl</code> <em>process</em>|<em>pthread</em>|<em>application</em></dt><dd><p>Use GEOPM runtime and launch GEOPM with one of three methods:
<em>process</em>, <em>pthread</em> or <em>application</em>.  The <em>process</em> method
allocates one extra MPI process per node for the GEOPM controller,
and this is the default method if the <code>--geopm-ctl</code> option is not
provided.  The <em>pthread</em> method spawns a thread from one MPI process
per node to run the GEOPM controller.  The <em>application</em> method
launches the <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmctl.1.html">geopmctl<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> application in the background which
connects to the primary compute application.  The <em>process</em> method
can be used in the widest variety of cases, but some systems require
that each MPI process be assigned the same number of CPUs which may
waste resources by assigning more than one CPU to the GEOPM
controller process.  The <em>pthread</em> option requires support for
MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, which is not enabled at many sites; in
addition, on some systems affinitizing one extra CPU to the MPI
process containing the controller thread may be not be possible,
resulting in running the GEOPM controller on the same CPU as the
main compute application.  The <em>application</em> method of launch is not
compatible with <code>aprun</code>; with <code>srun</code>, the call must be made inside
of an existing allocation made with salloc or sbatch and the command
must request all of the compute nodes assigned to the allocation.
This option is used by the launcher to set the GEOPM_CTL environment
variable.  The command line option will override any value currently
set in the environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of
<strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-agent</code> agent</dt><dd><p>Specify the Agent type.  The Agent defines the control algorithm
used by the GEOPM runtime.  Available agents are: "monitor" (default
if option not specified; enables profiling features only),
"power_balancer" (optimizes runtime under a power cap),
"power_governor" (enforces a uniform power cap), "frequency_map"
(runs each region at a specifed frequency), and "energy_efficient"
(saves energy).  See <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm_agent_monitor.7.html">geopm_agent_monitor<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>,

and <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm_agent_energy_efficient.7.html">geopm_agent_energy_efficient<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong> for descriptions of each
agent.  For more details on the responsibilities of the Agent, see
<strong><a class="man-ref" href="GEOPM_CXX_MAN_Agent.3.html">geopm::Agent<span class="s">(3)</span></a></strong>.  This option is used by the launcher to set the
GEOPM_AGENT environment variable.  The command line option will
override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-policy</code> policy</dt><dd><p>GEOPM policy JSON file used to configure the Agent plugin.  If the
policy is provided through this file, it will only be read once and
cannot be changed dynamically.  In this mode, samples will not be
provided to the resource manager.  See <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopmagent.1.html">geopmagent<span class="s">(1)</span></a></strong> and
<strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm_agent_c.3.html">geopm_agent_c<span class="s">(3)</span></a></strong> for more information about how to create this
input file.  This option is used by the launcher to set the
GEOPM_POLICY environment variable.  The command line option will
override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-endpoint</code> endpoint</dt><dd><p>Prefix for shared memory keys used by the endpoint.  The endpoint
will be used to receive policies dynamically from the resource
manager.  The shared memory for the endpoint does not use the
<code>--geopm-shmkey</code> prefix.  Refer to <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm_endpoint_c.3.html">geopm_endpoint_c<span class="s">(3)</span></a></strong> for more
detail.  If this option is provided, the GEOPM controller will also
send samples to the endpoint at runtime, depending on the Agent
selected.  This option overrides the use of <code>--geopm-policy</code> to
receive policy values.  This option is used by the launcher to set
the GEOPM_ENDPOINT environment variable.  The command line option
will override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-shmkey</code> key</dt><dd><p>Specify a special prefix to be used with all of the shared memory
keys generated by the GEOPM runtime for communication with the
application.  It is not used for the endpoint.  This is useful for
avoiding collisions with keys that were not properly cleaned up.
The default key prefix is "geopm-shm".  A shared memory key must
have no occurrences of the '/' character.  The base key is used as
the prefix for each shared memory region used by the runtime.  If
the keys are left behind, a simple command to clean up after an
aborted job is:</p>

<p>  <code>$ test -n "$GEOPM_SHMKEY" &amp;&amp; rm -f /dev/shm${GEOPM_SHMKEY}* || rm -f /dev/shm/geopm-shm*</code></p>

<p>This option is used by the launcher to set the GEOPM_SHMKEY
environment variable.  The command line option will override any
value currently set in the environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section
of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-timeout</code> sec</dt><dd><p>Time in seconds that the application should wait for the GEOPM
controller to connect over shared memory.  The default value is 30
seconds.  This option is used by the launcher to set the
GEOPM_TIMEOUT environment variable.  The command line option will
override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-plugin-path</code> path</dt><dd><p>The search path for GEOPM plugins. It is a colon-separated list of
directories used by GEOPM to search for shared objects which contain
GEOPM plugins.  In order to be available to the GEOPM runtime,
plugins should register themselves with the appropriate factory.
See <strong><a class="man-ref" href="GEOPM_CXX_MAN_PluginFactory.3.html">geopm::PluginFactory<span class="s">(3)</span></a></strong> for information about the GEOPM
plugin interface.  A zero-length directory name indicates the
current working directory; this can be specified by a leading or
trailing colon, or two adjacent colons.  The default search location
is always loaded first and is determined at library configuration
time and by way of the 'pkglib' variable (typically
/usr/lib64/geopm/).  This option is used by the launcher to set the
GEOPM_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.  The command line option
will override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-record-filter</code> filter:</dt><dd><p></p>

<p>Applies the user specified filter to the application record data
feed.  The filters currently supported are "proxy_epoch" and
"edit_distance".  These filters can be used to infer the application
outer loop (epoch) without modifying the application by inserting
calls to <code>geopm_prof_epoch()</code> (see <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm_prof_c.3.html">geopm_prof_c<span class="s">(3)</span></a></strong>).  Region
entry and exit may be captured automatically through runtimes such
as MPI and OpenMP.</p>

<p>The "proxy_epoch" filter looks for entries into a specific region
that serves as a proxy for epoch events.  The filter is specified as
a comma-separated list.  The first value selects the filter by name:
"proxy_epoch". The second value in the comma-separated list
specifies a region that will be used as a proxy for calls to
geopm_prof_epoch().  If the value can be interpreted as an integer,
it will be used as the numerical region hash of the region name,
otherwise, the value is interpreted as the region name.  The third
value that can be provided in the comma-separated list is optional.
If provided, it specifies the number of region entries into the
proxy region that are expected per outer loop.  By default this is
assumed to be 1.  The fourth optional parameter that can be
specified in the comma-separated list is the number of region
entries into the proxy region that are expected prior to the outer
loop beginning.  By default this is assumed to be 0.  In the
following example, the MPI_Barrier region entry is used as a proxy
for the epoch event:</p>

<pre><code>--geopm-record-filter=proxy_epoch,MPI_Barrier
</code></pre>

<p>In the next example the MPI_Barrier region is specified as a hash
and the calls per outer loop is given as 6:</p>

<pre><code>--geopm-record-filter=proxy_epoch,0x7b561f45,6
</code></pre>

<p>In the last example the calls prior to startup is specified as 10:</p>

<pre><code>--geopm-record-filter=proxy_epoch,MPI_Barrier,6,10
</code></pre>

<p>Note: you must specify the calls per outer loop in order to specify
the calls prior to startup.</p>

<p>The "edit_distance" filter will attempt to infer the epoch based on
patterns in the region entry events using an edit distance
algorithm.  The filter is specified as string beginning with the
name "edit_distance"; if optional parameters are specified, they are
provided as a comma-separated list following the name.  The first
parameter is the buffer size; the default if not provided is 100.
The second parameter is the minimum stable period length in number
of records.  The third parameter is the stable period hysteresis
factor.  The fourth parameter is the unstable period hysteresis
factor.  In the following example, the "edit_distance" filter will
be used with all optional parameters provided:</p>

<pre><code>--geopm-record-filter=edit_distance,200,8,2.0,3.0
</code></pre></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-debug-attach</code> rank</dt><dd><p>Enables a serial debugger such as gdb to attach to a job when the
GEOPM PMPI wrappers are enabled.  If set to a numerical value, the
associated rank will wait in MPI_Init() until a debugger is attached
and the local variable "cont" is set to a non-zero value.  If set,
but not to a numerical value then all ranks will wait.  The runtime
will print a message explaining the hostname and process ID that the
debugger should attach to.  This option is used by the launcher to
set the GEOPM_DEBUG_ATTACH environment variable.  The command line
option will override any value currently set in the environment.
See the ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-region-barrier</code></dt><dd><p>Enables a node local MPI_Barrier() at time of calling
<code>geopm_region_enter</code>() or <code>geopm_region_exit</code>() for all application
ranks that share a node.  Since the GEOPM controller only considers
a region to be entered when all ranks on a node have entered the
region, enabling this feature forces control throughout all of the
time every rank spends in a region.  This feature is primarily used
for debugging purposes.  WARNING: If all regions marked in the
application are not entered synchronously by all ranks on a node
then enabling this feature will cause a deadlock and the application
will hang.  This option is used by the launcher to set the
GEOPM_REGION_BARRIER environment variable.  The command line option
will override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
ENVIRONMENT section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong>.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-hyperthreads-disable</code></dt><dd><p>Prevent the launcher from trying to use hyperthreads for pinning
purposes when attempting to satisfy the MPI ranks / OMP threads
configuration specified.  This is done for both the controller and
the application.  An error is raised if the launcher cannot satisfy
the current request without hyperthreads.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-ctl-disable</code></dt><dd><p>Used to allow passing the command through to the underlying launcher.
By default, <code>geopmlaunch</code> will launch the GEOPM runtime in process mode.
When this option is specified, the GEOPM runtime will not be launched.</p></dd>
<dt><code>--geopm-ompt-disable</code></dt><dd><p>Disable OMPT detection of OpenMP regions.  See the INTEGRATION WITH OMPT
section of <strong><a class="man-ref" href="geopm.7.html">geopm<span class="s">(7)</span></a></strong> for more information about OpenMP region detection.</p></dd>

<h2 id="EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>Use geopmlaunch to queue a job using geopmbench on a SLURM managed system
requesting two nodes using 32 application MPI process each with four threads:</p>

<pre><code>geopmlaunch srun -N 2 -n 32 -c 4 \
                 --geopm-ctl=process \
                 --geopm-report=tutorial6.report \
                 -- ./geopmbench tutorial6_config.json
</code></pre>

<p>Use geopmlaunch to launch the miniFE executable with the same configuration,
but on an ALPS managed system:</p>

<pre><code>geopmlaunch aprun -N 2 -n 64 --cpus-per-pe 4 \
                  --geopm-ctl process \
                  --geopm-report miniFE.report \
                  -- ./miniFE.x -nx 256 -ny 256 -nz 256
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</h2>

<p>Every command line option to the launcher can also be specified as an
environment variable if desired (with the exception of <code>--geopm-ctl</code>).
For example, instead of specifying <code>--geopm-region-barrier</code> one can
instead set in the environment <code>GEOPM_REGION_BARRIER=true</code> prior to
invoking the launcher script.  The environment variables are named the
same as the command line option but have the hyphens replaced with
underscores, and are all uppercase.  The command line options take
precedence over the environment variables.</p>

<p>The usage of <code>--geopm-ctl</code> here is slightly different than how the
controller handles the <code>GEOPM_CTL</code> environment variable.  In the
case of the launcher, one can specify <em>process</em>, <em>pthread</em>, or
<em>application</em> to the command line argument.  In the case of
<code>GEOPM_CTL</code> one can ONLY specify <code>process</code> or <code>pthread</code>, as
launching the controller as a separate application is handled through
the <code>geopmctl</code> binary.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the environment is affected if either of the
GEOPM configuration files exist:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/geopm/environment-default.json
/etc/geopm/environment-override.json
</code></pre>

<p>These files may specify system default and override settings for all
of the GEOPM environment variables.  The <code>environment-default.json</code>
file contains a JSON object mapping GEOPM environment variable strings
to strings that define default values for any unspecified GEOPM
environment variable or unspecified <code>geopmlaunch</code> command line
options.  The <code>environment-override.json</code> contains a JSON object that
defines values for GEOPM environment variables that take precedence
over any settings provided by the user either through the environment
or through the <code>geopmlaunch</code> command line options.  The order of
precedence for each GEOPM variable is: override configuration file,
<code>geopmlaunch</code> command line option, environment setting, the default
configuration file, and finally there are some preset default values
that are coded into GEOPM which have the lowest precedence.</p>

<p>The <code>KMP_WARNINGS</code> environment variable is set to 'FALSE', thus
disabling the Intel OpenMP warnings.  This avoids warnings emitted
because the launcher configures the <code>OMP_PROC_BIND</code> environment
variable to support applications compiled with a non-Intel
implementation of OpenMP.</p>
